			<hr>

			<p>Your privacy is important to us. It is Heatic's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect from you through our app, Heatic Debate App.</p>

			<p>We only ask for personal information when we truly need it to provide a service to you. We collect it by fair and lawful means, with your knowledge and consent. We also let you know why we’re collecting it and how it will be used.</p>

			<p>We only retain collected information for as long as necessary to provide you with your requested service. We protect your data using commercially acceptable means to prevent loss, theft, and unauthorized access or disclosure.</p>

			<p><strong>✴ If a user is inactive for 7 days, their data is permanently deleted from our servers.</strong></p>

			<p>We don’t share any personally identifying information publicly or with third parties, except when required by law.</p>

			<p>Your continued use of our app is considered acceptance of our practices around privacy and personal information. Contact us for any queries: <a href="mailto:heaticdeveloper@gmail.com">Heatic Developer</a></p>

			<h3>1. Privacy Principles</h3>
			<hr>

			<p>Heatic has one fundamental principle regarding private data:</p>
			<p>We only store the data necessary for Heatic to function as a secure and feature-rich service: Email, IP Address, and device info (like Android version, device name, and network info). This is for security only and deleted upon account deletion.</p>

			<h3>2. What Personal Data We Use</h3>
			<h5>2.1. Basic Account Data</h5>
			<p>You provide your email and basic data (profile name, picture) to create a Heatic account.</p>

			<h5>2.2. Automatically Collected Information</h5>
			<p>Device and connection-specific info (like IP address) is collected for security. It's deleted when the user deletes their account.</p>

			<h3>3. User-Generated Content</h3>
			<p>Users can report inappropriate content. Offenders may be blocked from the app. Spamming, disrespect, or abusive language results in account termination.</p>

			<h3>4. Third-Party Services</h3>
			<p>We use trusted third-party services for analytics and performance monitoring:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/" target="_blank">Google Play Services</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/policies/analytics" target="_blank">Google Analytics for Firebase</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy/" target="_blank">Firebase Crashlytics</a></li>
			</ul>

			<h3>5. Information Collection and Use</h3>
			<p>We may require certain personally identifiable info for a better user experience. This data stays on your device and is not collected by us unless otherwise stated.</p>

			<h3>6. Policy Changes</h3>
			<p>Any updates to this policy will be notified via app notifications. <br><strong>Effective as of:</strong> May 1, 2020</p>
